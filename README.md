# YouTube Crash Course Code Readme

This repository contains code examples from a YouTube Crash Course on various fundamental JavaScript concepts. The purpose of this code is for learning purposes and not meant to be executed as a complete application. Below is a brief overview of the code sections and what they cover:

1. **Logging Output**
   - Demonstrates how to use `alert`, `console.log`, `console.error`, and `console.warn` for logging output in JavaScript.

2. **Variables**
   - Covers the usage of `var`, `let`, and `const` for declaring and modifying variables in JavaScript.

3. **Data Types**
   - Explains various data types in JavaScript, such as String, Number, Boolean, null, and undefined.

4. **Strings**
   - Demonstrates string manipulation, concatenation, and various string methods like `toUpperCase`, `toLowerCase`, `substring`, and `split`.

5. **Arrays**
   - Explains how to create and manipulate arrays, including adding elements, removing elements, and accessing elements by index.

6. **Object Literals**
   - Introduces object literals, accessing object properties, and handling nested objects.

7. **Loops**
   - Covers `for` and `while` loops, looping through arrays, and `for...of` loop for iterating over array elements.

8. **High Order Array Methods**
   - Demonstrates higher-order array methods such as `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`.

9. **Conditionals**
   - Introduces conditional statements, including `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.

10. **Functions**
    - Covers function declarations and arrow functions, including default parameters and returning values.

11. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    - Introduces constructor functions and prototypes for creating objects in JavaScript.

12. **ES6 Classes**
    - Demonstrates the use of ES6 classes for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

13. **Element Selectors**
    - Explains how to select and access elements from the DOM using various methods.

14. **Manipulating the DOM**
    - Shows how to modify the DOM by changing element content and styles.

15. **Events**
    - Covers event handling for mouse clicks and keyboard inputs, and demonstrates how to listen for form submissions.

16. **User Form Script**
    - A simple user form script that listens for form submissions and displays user input in a list.

Please note that this code is for learning purposes only and may not follow best practices or be complete for production applications. Use it to gain a basic understanding of JavaScript concepts and explore further on your own to build more sophisticated applications.

Remember, always experiment and practice coding to enhance your skills and understanding of the language. Happy learning!
